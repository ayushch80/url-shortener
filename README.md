CREATE TABLE urls (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    short_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

PRODUCTION=[Whether it should run in production mode (true or omit the line)]
PUBLIC_PORT=[The port on which the server should run]
SQL_HOST=<MySQL host>
SQL_USER=<MySQL user>
SQL_PASSWORD=<MySQL password>
```

-    Start the server
```sh
node app.js
```

## Usage

-    To shorten a long URL, visit `http://localhost:3000/shorten?longUrl=<long-url>` in your browser.
-    To redirect a short URL to its corresponding long URL, visit `http://localhost:3000/<short-url>` in your browser.
-    To view the contents of the urls table, visit `http://localhost:3000/urls` in your browser.

## Note

 -   The server is running on port 3000, you can change it as per your requirement.
 -   The database credentials should be updated as per your setup.
 -   Make sure to validate the input and sanitize the output when displaying data from a database to prevent SQL injection and other security risks.
 -   The `/urls` route should only be accessible to authorized personnel and should be removed or secured in a production environment.
 -   Displaying raw data from the database on a web page can also be a security concern. It would be a good idea to only show the necessary information and not the entire database.
